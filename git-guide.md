Hi all!  
We highly recommend that you start using **Git** for your project management.  

**TL;DR**  
Let's Git coding.

## What is Git?

Git is an Open Source **Distributed Version Control System**. Now that’s a lot of words to define Git.

Let me break it down and explain the wording:

- **Control System:** This basically means that Git is a content tracker. So Git can be used to store content — it is mostly used to store code due to the other features it provides.

- **Version Control System:** The code which is stored in Git keeps changing as more code is added. Also, many developers can add code in parallel. So Version Control System helps in handling this by maintaining a history of what changes have happened. Also, Git provides features like branches and merges, which I will be covering later.
- **Distributed Version Control System:** Git has a remote repository which is stored in a server and a local repository which is stored in the computer of each developer. This means that the code is not just stored in a central server, but the full copy of the code is present in all the developers’ computers. Git is a Distributed Version Control System since the code is present in every developer’s computer.

## Why Git?

- Real life projects generally have multiple developers working in parallel. So a version control system like Git is needed to ensure there are no code conflicts between the developers.

- Additionally, the requirements in such projects change often. So a version control system allows developers to revert and go back to an older version of the code.

- Finally, sometimes several projects which are being run in parallel involve the same codebase. In such a case, the concept of branching in Git is very important.


## Download Git

- Verify if Git is already installed by using the following command in the command prompt:
```
$ git --version
```
